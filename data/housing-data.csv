The building was originally built in 1919 and was the original home to Eddie Bauer when they first started. I originally bought the unit primarily because of its huge wraparound private deck at just over 560 sq/ft of outdoor entertaining and living space. This is in addition to the 2 level interior living space of 830 sq/ft for a combined 1,390 sq/ft of wonderful outdoor/indoor living. Completely remodeled in 2016/2017 - this unit features fully integrated heat pump for both A/C in the summer and warmth in the winter, heated floors throughout the complete upstairs area, beautiful new bamboo flooring on the lower level, Blomberg washer/dryer with heat pump function, tankless water heater, new window blinds with adjustable bottom up and top down features, and updated electrical. Store all of your clothes in the expansive multiple built-in closet space, additional closet space in the master bath for you or your significant other, soft close drawers, updated sub panel electrical, beautiful natural light, and updated lighting throughout. During the day you may never need to turn on your lights because of the natural light exposure from both the North and East in this unobstructed corner unit. Live the downtown dream right in the heart of Pike-Pine corridor. So many shops, bars, restaurants, and entertainment all within walking distance or a short Uber ride. As NYC-SOHO as you can get with unprecedented outdoor living on Capitol Hill. Spacious parking spot in secure garage with electrical hookup to charge your car, ideal spot right by the elevator shared with only a few other residents. Parking spot is one of the largest with space enough for an additional scooter or motorcycle along with shelving storage. Parking entrance is through Crawford Place making for very easy entry and exit. Real Wood burning fireplace - Pet Friendly - This unit in the Portofino combines the best of old world beauty and character from 1919 with a fully updated interior. From this location you have the accessibility of being five blocks to downtown, three blocks to Broadway and minutes from First Hill. This serene retreat is only steps away from Cal Anderson Park, the streetcar, the new light rail station and all the amenities of Capitol Hill. A great place for work-at-home situation or East-side commute. Easy access to I-5 and 520. Walking distance to everything Capitol Hill has to offer! Easy commuting to Amazon, Microsoft, Gates Foundation, Swedish Hospital, Group Health, Harborview, First Hill, Downtown, SLU, and, South Lake Union! Please do not contact if you are trying to list or help sell. I welcome all buyer representatives - full buyers commission will be applied at closing. I love the tremendous natural light of this unit gets as a top floor corner unit spread over 2 levels. You simply will not find another unit with so much private outdoor space in the downtown core and the location is simply unbeatable for arts, entertainment, eating, and transportation anywhere. A true lifestyle unit in the heart of the best part of the city with parking and charging for your electric car already setup. A true one-of-a kind gem."
